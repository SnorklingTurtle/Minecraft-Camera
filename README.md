## Limitations
* Each surface displays just one color. If you see any colors that feels off, let me know.
* Players and mobs won't show up on pictures - *X-Files theme plays*
* Image are distorted when looking up/down.

## Todo
* Test with Geyser
* Don't take picture, when cancelling placement of camera.
* Check if downloading the texture pack zip is needed (389 KB). If texture pack is needed:
  * Move texture pack zip to this repository 
  * Upgrade texture pack to 1.20.4
  * Make the url to texture pack configurable
* Add option to place camera on the ground (might conflict with claims plugin).
